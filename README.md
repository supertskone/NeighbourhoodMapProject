Welcome to my city & neighborhood :)
# Nis, Serbia - Udacity Neighborhood Map Project -> Udacity Front-End Web Development Course Nanodegree

This project is **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**.
Intention was to put together a website from Wikipedia API and KnockoutJS framework into very interesting application.
This project includes Google Maps with API key.

Here is a list of my favorite places in my town. It is small by I'll call it city. :)
Application allows filtering places visible on map. When user types, it displays the reduced locations on the map.
There is extra info from Wikipedia, about searched place.

# How To Use It
- Unzip folder NeighborhoodMap.zip
- Double click on index_main.html filtering
- Application will start in new Chrome (or any other) tab
- Type location name into search box, or click on list item
- Marker click will show you more data about certain location

Enjoy! :)
